## Code conventions

Read our global [CONTRIBUTING
guidelines](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and the [AI usage
policy](https://github.com/kubewarden/community/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md).

## Requirements

You need the following tools to build and run this project:

- **Docker**: for building and running containerized workloads.
- **Go**: required by all the components. The exact version is defined in `go.mod`.
- **clang, llvm, libbpf and libelf**: required to compile the eBPF programs in
  `bpf/`. eBPF programs run inside the Linux kernel. On Debian and Ubuntu,
  install the `clang`, `llvm`, `libbpf-dev`, `libelf-dev` and `build-essential`
  packages.
- **[protoc](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)**: required to
  regenerate the gRPC code in `proto/`.
- **Make**: the build tool controlling various build tasks.
- **[Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/)**: a development tool for multi-service applications.
- **Kubernetes cluster**: a running Kubernetes cluster, used for development. [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
  or a similar solution.
- **[Helm](https://helm.sh/)**: required for deploying and testing charts. The
  chart tests need the
  [helm-unittest](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest) plugin.
- **[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)**: runs all the linters.

The following tools are optional:

- **Node.js**: required to run [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) on
  your machine.
- **[bpfvalidator](https://github.com/Andreagit97/bpfvalidator)**: runs the
  eBPF tests against multiple kernel versions.

## Code Layout

The repository has the following layout:

- `api`: the Go types of the `WorkloadPolicy` and `WorkloadPolicyProposal`
  CRDs (custom resource definitions).
- `bpf`: the C source code of the eBPF programs.
- `charts`: contains the Helm chart for managing deployments.
- `cmd`: main entry points for the `agent`, `controller`, `debugger` and
  `kubectl-plugin` executables.
- `docs`: developer-focused documentation, the generated CRD reference and the RFCs.
- `hack`: helper scripts and the Dockerfiles used by Tilt.
- `internal`: the private Go implementation packages used by the executables.
- `package`: the Dockerfiles of the released container images.
- `pkg/generated`: the generated Kubernetes clientset, informers and listers.
- `proto`: the gRPC API between the agent and the other components.
- `test/e2e`: end-to-end tests. A real Kubernetes cluster is created using Docker and Kind.
- `updatecli`: the automation that bumps dependencies and the Helm chart.

## Linting and Formatting

All the linters run through [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). The
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file defines them. CI runs the same hooks.

Install the hooks in your local clone:

```console
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Run all the linters on all the files:

```console
make generate-ebpf
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The `make generate-ebpf` step is required because the Go linter needs the
generated eBPF objects.

### Go

Format Go code:

```console
make fmt
```

Run `go vet`:

```console
make vet
```

Run the Go linter ([golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)):

```console
pre-commit run golangci-lint-full --all-files
```

### eBPF

Format the C code with `clang-format`:

```console
pre-commit run clang-format --all-files
```

Lint the C code with `clang-tidy`:

```console
pre-commit run clang-tidy --all-files
```

### Protobuf

Lint the `.proto` files with [protolint](https://github.com/yoheimuta/protolint):

```console
pre-commit run protolint --all-files
```

## Building

### Build All Components

Build the controller, the agent and the debugger:

```console
make controller
make agent
make debugger
```

Make writes the binaries to `bin/`.

### Build the kubectl plugin

Build the plugin for your platform:

```console
make kubectl-plugin
```

Build the plugin for all the supported platforms:

```console
make kubectl-plugin-cross
```

### Build Container Images

Build Docker images for each component:

```console
make build-controller-image
make build-agent-image
make build-debugger-image
```

You can customize the repository and the tag using environment variables:

```console
make build-controller-image REPO=ghcr.io/your-username/runtime-enforcer TAG=dev
```

## Development

To run the controller, the agent and the debugger for development purposes, you
can use [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/).

### Settings

The `tilt-settings.yaml.example` acts as a template for the
`tilt-settings.yaml` file that you need to create in the root of this
repository. Copy the example file and edit it to match your environment. Git
ignores the `tilt-settings.yaml` file, so you cannot commit it by mistake.

The file accepts the following keys:

- `controller.image`: the name of the controller image. If you are using
  `ghcr.io` as your registry, you need to prefix the image name with your GitHub
  username.

- `agent.image`: the name of the agent image. If you are using `ghcr.io` as
  your registry, you need to prefix the image name with your GitHub username.

- `debugger.image`: the name of the debugger image. If you are using `ghcr.io`
  as your registry, you need to prefix the image name with your GitHub username.

- `clusters`: the list of Kubernetes contexts that Tilt can use. Tilt allows
  local clusters like kind by default. If you use a different cluster, add its
  context here.

Example:

```yaml
controller:
  image: ghcr.io/your-github-username/runtime-enforcer/controller
agent:
  image: ghcr.io/your-github-username/runtime-enforcer/agent
debugger:
  image: ghcr.io/your-github-username/runtime-enforcer/debugger
clusters:
  - my-cluster
```

### Running

The `Tiltfile` included in this repository takes care of the following:

- Installs cert-manager and the cert-manager-csi-driver.
- Creates the `runtime-enforcer` namespace.
- Installs the `runtime-enforcer` Helm chart from the `charts` folder, with the
  debugger enabled.
- Injects the development images into the running Pods.
- Rebuilds and reloads the controller, the agent and the debugger on every
  code change.

To run the project, run the following command against an empty cluster:

```console
tilt up
```

Use the web interface of Tilt to monitor the log streams of the different
components. If needed, trigger restarts by hand from the same interface.

The agent needs a node that runs containerd or CRI-O with NRI (Node Resource
Interface) enabled. See the [compatibility
page](https://docs.kubewarden.io/runtime-enforcer/latest/en/compatibility.html)
for the kernel and runtime requirements.

## Changes to CRDs and other generated code

After changing a CRD, a `.proto` file, an eBPF program, a kubectl plugin command
or the Helm chart `values.yaml`, run the following command:

```console
make generate
```

This will:

- Update all the generated Go code
- Update the CRDs and the RBAC rules shipped by our Helm chart
- Update the CRD reference in `docs/crds/CRD-docs-for-docs-repo.adoc`
- Update the eBPF objects in `internal/bpf`
- Update the gRPC code in `proto/`
- Update the clientset, informers and listers in `pkg/generated`
- Update the `values.schema.json` of the Helm chart
- Update the kubectl plugin reference in `docs/kubectl-plugin/cli-docs.adoc`

CI runs `make generate` on each pull request. If the generated files are not up
to date, CI fails.

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all unit tests:

```console
make test
```

The target downloads the envtest binaries into `bin/` on the first run.

Run the eBPF tests. They need root because they load eBPF programs into the
running kernel:

```console
make test-bpf
```

Run e2e tests:

```console
make test-e2e
```

The target builds the container images, creates a kind cluster, installs the
chart and runs the tests. The following environment variables change this
behavior:

- `E2E_USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=true`: use the cluster of your current kubeconfig
  instead of creating a kind cluster. Make does not rebuild the images.
- `E2E_NO_REBUILD=true`: do not rebuild the container images.
- `E2E_DEPENDENCIES`: a comma-separated list of the dependencies that the tests
  install. The accepted values are `cert-manager` and `cert-manager-csi-driver`.
  Use `none` to install nothing. When the variable is not set, the tests install
  all the dependencies.

The tests write the logs of the cluster to `test/e2e/logs`.

### Helm Chart Tests

Run Helm chart unit tests:

```console
make helm-unittest
```

### Writing tests

Most of the Go unit tests use the standard `testing` package and
[testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify).

The controller tests use the [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and
[Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) testing frameworks. The tests are in
the `internal/controller` and `internal/eventhandler` packages.

These tests run with [envtest](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/envtest).
envtest starts an instance of etcd and the Kubernetes API server, without
kubelet, controller-manager, or other components.

Some tests require a real Kubernetes cluster to run. These tests are in the
`test/e2e` folder and use the
[e2e-framework](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework).

The suite setup starts a cluster with [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and
runs the tests against it. When the tests finish, the suite deletes the
cluster.

The `e2e` tests are slower than the `envtest` tests. As a result, keep their
number to a minimum.

### Focusing on Specific Tests

You can focus on a specific Ginkgo spec by using a [Focused
Spec](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#focused-specs).

Example:

```go
var _ = Describe("Controller test", func() {
    FIt("should do something", func() {
        // This spec will be the only one executed
    })
})
```

### Testing eBPF on multiple kernels

CI runs the eBPF tests against multiple kernel versions with
[bpfvalidator](https://github.com/Andreagit97/bpfvalidator). The tool boots
each kernel in a virtual machine and runs the test binary inside it. The
kernel list is in `bpfvalidator-amd64-config.yaml` and
`bpfvalidator-arm64-config.yaml`.

To run the same tests on your machine:

1. Install bpfvalidator from its [release
   page](https://github.com/Andreagit97/bpfvalidator/releases), or build it
   from source.
2. Generate the eBPF objects and build the test binary from the root of the repository:

   ```console
   make generate-ebpf
   go test -c ./internal/bpf/... -o tester
   ```

3. Run the tests against all the kernels of your architecture:

   ```console
   bpfvalidator --config "./bpfvalidator-$(go env GOARCH)-config.yaml" --cmd="./tester -test.v"
   ```

## Commit subjects

The commit messages must follow the [conventional commits
standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). For example:

- `type: free form subject`

Common `type` values include:

- `feat`: a commit that introduces a new feature
- `fix`: a commit that fixes an issue
- `perf`: a commit that improves performance
- `refactor`: a commit that refactors some code

Some examples:

- `feat: this is a new feature`
- `fix: this is fixing a reported bug`

You can also specify a component if this commit targets one component
specifically.

- `feat(agent): this adds a new event type`

CI runs [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) on the commits of each pull
request. The rules are in `commitlint.config.js`. To run commitlint on your
machine:

```console
npm ci
npx commitlint --from main
```

## Releasing

The [release issue
template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/3-runtime-enforcer-release.yml) documents the
release process. Open a new issue from that template to track a release. The
[release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) starts when you push a
`v*.*.*` tag.
